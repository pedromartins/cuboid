Cuboid!

A simple 3D haskell game written using Yampa and GLUT.

The game is cabalized, so to build:
1. Make sure you have the dependencies installed: Yampa and glut
2. cabal configure
3. cabal build

Then, you can find the game binary in the dist folder.

The objective of the game is to get the red sphere to the green
sphere, by moving the red sphere.

Use the W and D keys to rotate the cube, and the arrow keys
(up/down/left/right), to move the red ball (front/back/left/right
respectively).  The red sphere will then move until it hits an
obstacle (green cube) and then stops.

In order to add levels check out Game.hs. If you come up with a
great level do send it to me. I plan to extract the levels into a
configuration file in the future.

Hope this helps people get into Yampa and FRP for game development,
as it is quite fun!
